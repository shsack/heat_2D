# Heat time evolution
The heat equation 

![heat](http://mathurl.com/yaqjp2kr.png) 

is numerically solved to generate the time evolution of imposed boundary conditions.


## Running the program

To run the program you have to type


```
python3 heat_2D.py

```

This will generate the `heat_evolution.mp4`  file that shows the time evolution of the heat.
